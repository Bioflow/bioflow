[X] - the delete icon doesnt appear when restoring jobs

DRAG and DROP icon should change --- Right now it is a FASTA div or something

1. Create a form to add new tools

2. Change job engine to work with any type of tool

3. VALIDATIONS for connections - input type bam file should not be allowed to connect to anything else

4. First Page - Sign In , Description 

5. View Outputs Page - Needs Headers and other decoration stuff

6. Publication !! How How How


7. Need to use USER ID in all queries .. Right now I dont know what will happen if two users use simultaneously 

8. Make it work for multiple outputs

show output on same page
DONE

show JOB STATUS - somewhere ... right now there is no indication that the job is running or pending or whatever .. need to show that
DONE	
	
	
disable RUN button when job has already RUN
DONE

1 ) Need job status 
	Currently there is individual job's statuses. i.e. sam tools has status, twininput has status. Now, a status is required for the main job.
	This will help in sending job status to client.
	-- DID I DO THIS? IF YES, I NEED TO WRITE IT HERE
	
	DONE




3) Restore needs to be fixed a little ... See, if widget1, 2 and 5 have been restored, then the workflow will think that widget1, 2 and 3 have been repalced.
	Later on it will generate widget5 as id and this will crash !!
	DONE - CHANGED IDs to timestamp  




RESTORE - the job should show up on left side
DONE

RESTORE - this job should be usable with currently existing widgets -- STEP 2
DONE
